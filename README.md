This is a collaborative repository where students create their profiles and connect to others. This will be written in HTML and Bootstrap.


### What's amazing?
It's going to be completely compiled by our students and a great platform to connect with all coding ninjas students.

- in the terminal run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodingNinjasCodes/wall-of-developers.git` (this is for taking a fresh update of the code anytime in the future)
- create a new branch from the [Branch Types](#branch-types) below
- **Important Step:** get the updated code by running command `git pull upstream development` in terminal
